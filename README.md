Saves the DerivedData folder and the related metadata into Bitrise Build Cache to speed up subsequent builds.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This steps caches the DerivedData folder and the related metadata required to speed up subsequent builds. The cache is stored in the Bitrise Build Cache infrastructure.

If not specified otherwise, the complete system DerivedData folder (`$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`) is cached. As xcodebuild only reuses DerivedData if the input files'
modification time is the same, the step also collects and saves the modification time of the input files (project files including source code files) into a metadata file.

NOTE: you need to have an activate Bitrise Build Cache Trial or Subscription for your workspace to use this step.
