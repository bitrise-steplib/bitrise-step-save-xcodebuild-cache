title: Save xcodebuild Bitrise Build Cache
summary: Caches the DerivedData folder used by xcodebuild. Uses the Bitrise Build Cache infrastructure.
description: |
  This steps caches the DerivedData folder and the related metadata required to speed up subsequent builds. The cache is stored in the Bitrise Build Cache infrastructure.

  If not specified otherwise, the complete system DerivedData folder (`$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`) is cached. As xcodebuild only reuses DerivedData if the input files'
  modification time does not change, the step also collects and saves the modification time of the input files (project files including source code files) into a metadata file.

  NOTE: you need to have an activate Bitrise Build Cache Trial or Subscription for your workspace to use this step.

      This needs to be set to the root folder of the project containing the source code files of the build. The step takes the metadata of the input files from this folder.

      When the cache is restored, the metadata of the files in this folder is restored as well. This ensures Xcode recognizes the cached DerivedData folder.

      Path to the DerivedData folder used by the build. By default, this is set to the system DerivedData folder.

      If xcodebuild is executed with the `-derivedDataPath` flag, then this must be set to the same value.
      For example, if `xcodebuild -derivedData "~/DerivedData/MyProject"`` is used, then this must be set to `~/DerivedData/MyProject`.
