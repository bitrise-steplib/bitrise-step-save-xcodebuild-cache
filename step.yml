      This needs to be set to the root folder of the project to be built. The step takes the metadata of the input files from this folder.

      When the cache is restored, the metadata of the files in this folder is restored as well. This ensures Xcode recognizes the cached DerivedData folder.

      Path to the DerivedData folder used by the build. By default, this is set to the system DerivedData folder.

      If xcodebuild is executed with the `-derivedDataPath` flag, then this must be set to the same value.
      For example, if `xcodebuild -derivedData "~/DerivedData/MyProject"`` is used, then this must be set to `~/DerivedData/MyProject`.
